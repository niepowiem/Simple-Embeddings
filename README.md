# Simple-Embeddings
A lightweight library for quickly generating embeddings without training a neural network or using pre-trained models. It leverages simple techniques like tokenization, co-occurrence matrices, Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI), and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to create meaningful embeddings.
